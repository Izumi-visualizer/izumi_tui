# izumi_tui (aka Izumi)

Izumi is a multi-format instruction pipeline dump TUI visualizer based on [shioyadan/Konata](https://github.com/shioyadan/Konata). Izumi is the reference frontend for [Izumi-visualizer/libizumi](https://github.com/Izumi-visualizer/libizumi), which provides the required parsing capabilities.

> [!Note]
> The tool is still under development and may not work properly with full
> features of the format.

## Supported features

- Instruction

    Only support for file identificator
- Stage
- Line on left
- End of stage (for multiple cycle stages/stalling the pipeline)
- End of instruction

## Requirements

- `ncurses`
- `libizumi` (can be built alongside `izumi_tui`)
- `make` (build only)
- `autotools` (build from source only, not needed in distribution packages)

## Building (and installing)

If you cloned the repository instead of downloading a distribution package,
start by generating the build system:

```sh
autoreconf --install
```

With the `configure` script available, you can follow the traditional mantra:

```sh
mkdir build && cd build       # Any path supported!
../configure
make
(sudo) make install
```

Some intersting `configure` flags:
- `--without-system-libizumi` to build libizumi alongside izumi_tui (libizumi sources must be placed or linked in a `libizumi` directory next to the `configure` script)
- `--enable-sanitizers` to enable ASAN (not recommended if you aren't actively developing Izumi!)
- `--help` to see more options!

### Nix derivation

You can also use `nix` (flakes recommended):
```bash
nix run github:Izumi-visualizer/izumi_tui
```

## Usage

Use the installed `izumi` binary...
```sh
izumi path/to/file
```
... or use the `make` wrapper:
```sh
make run ARGS=path/to/file
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If sanitizers are enabled, an `AddressSanitizer:DEADLYSIGNAL` error can be raised randomly when starting the program. Just kill the program and try again. If it persists, please report it.

I know it's not the best looking tool, but it's a start (now it has colors :D).
